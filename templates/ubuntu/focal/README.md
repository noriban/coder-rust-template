# Rust - Ubuntu Focal

Develop in your browser with VS Code & the Rust language. Bring your dotfiles with you.

## How to use:

After setting up a workspace, click "VSCode" to open your IDE. You are ready to go!

## Installing packages:

If you commonly need a package on a workspace, you may want to create a seperate Docker image.

## "VSCode is offline" or "502 Bad Gateway" error:

It may take a moment for the IDE to go online. If it doesn't, try opening an issue [on the project repository](https://gitlab.com/8Bitz0/coder-rust-template).

## Issue with IDE

If you experience an issue with the IDE, try a seperate template to see if the issue persists. If you *still* experience the issue, try the [official Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) local application. If you have the issue on the online, but not the official application, submit an issue [here](https://github.com/coder/code-server). If you have an issue on the official application too, submit an issue [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode).
